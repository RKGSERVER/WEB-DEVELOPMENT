      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
       Since 2012, we've been the scrappy Austin startup that refused to think small. What started as a handful of dreamers in Texas has grown into something we're genuinely proud of—a team that helps businesses around the world solve their toughest problems with smart, custom solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're not just another tech company. We're the people who get excited about untangling complex challenges and turning "impossible" into "let's figure this out." Today, thousands of companies trust us to power their success, and honestly? That still amazes us every single day.
      </p>

    <section class="about-section" id="our-mission">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
       We believe technology should make life easier, not harder. That's why we build solutions that actually work—tools that help teams get more done, businesses grow faster, and communities thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is simple: create products people love to use because they genuinely make a difference. We're a team that celebrates different perspectives and crazy ideas, because that's where the best breakthroughs happen. Every day, we're asking ourselves: "What's next? How can we help our clients—and the world—do better?"
      </p>

    <section class="about-section" id="our-team">
      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>
       We're engineers who dream in code, designers who see beauty in function, strategists who love a good puzzle, and yes—a few people who just can't help but imagine better ways to do everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're fresh out of college or have decades under your belt, everyone here brings something special. We learn from each other, build amazing things together, and make sure to celebrate the wins—both the big ones and the "finally got that bug fixed at 2am" moments.
